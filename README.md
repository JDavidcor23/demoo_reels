## How to Run the Application
To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `client` directory and run `npm install` to install the frontend dependencies.
3. Navigate to the `server` directory and run `npm install` to install the backend dependencies.
4. Rename the `.env.template` file in the `server` directory to `.env` and add the necessary environment variables.
5. Run `npm run dev` in the `client` directory to start the frontend development server.
6. Run `npm run start` in the `server` directory to start the backend development server.

That's it! You should now be able to access the application at [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/)
